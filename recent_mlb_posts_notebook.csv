Without these Japanese players, the Dodgers would have fallen short before even reaching the World Series, but instead, they went on to win back-to-back titles for the first time in franchise history.

Mistakes of aggression

Calm in the eye of the storm

The long grind of the season and then a 7 game series that played 8 and a third long

Superstars putting on a show

Vets showing why they’re valuable

Rookies coming out of nowhere

Quadruple A players setting records

Mid-series lineup changes

Mid-inning defensive replacements paying off

Teammates that are closer to family than friends

A stoic manager a decade in with the same team being overcome by shock and surprise

Future HOFers making their last stand

Guys being a zero with the bat making every play in the field

Guys playing on one leg

Guys pitching on two, one, or zero days rest

Baseball being baseball until the home team is out of innings and runs

It was epic in every little way baseball always is and regardless of outcome it made you feel every second of it.

I’ve been watching baseball since before Vladimir Guerrero SR was born, so I think I’m qualified to say this was the greatest World Series of my lifetime.

It had EVERYTHING, start to finish, and it finished with more drama than a soap opera.

According to google ai (ngl that was the extent of my research) even the lowest net worth of MLB owners is 500 million dollars. Not a crazy amount as far as owners go, but still enough to afford high payroll and signing stars.

If other teams were willing to spend, not every star would go to just the dodgers or yankees or mets. Its not the dodgers ruing baseball. Clearly, they actually do it best. Its the majority of owners that treat teams like ATMs instead of competitive entities that are ruining baseball.

\- The manager of the Toronto Blue Jays has a very red face. Either sunburnt or drinking?

\- Gimenez was very dramatic. The way he would exaggerate dodging from a pitched ball reminded me of flopping in the NBA.

Perhaps the only true comparison is Keith Hernandez. Aside from being a 1bmen, he wins an MVP and WS on his 10 years with the Cardinals before winning in his later years on the Mets.

I stopped watching whenever they paywalled the local games and now catch one or two games a year live and then will watch the playoffs (not every game).  I have a few questions that I’m curious about.  

First, why did the Dodgers “ruin baseball”?   Aren’t the mechanisms they used (deferred salaries, paying up for players) something that literally every other team can do?  I get that the TV deal for LA or NY would be larger than a smaller city, but if you had an awesome team around renewal time, wouldn’t that work in your favor to extract more value?  I’m thinking about teams like GS Warriors, who were not worth much and then went on a dynastic run and now they’re one of the most valuable franchises around (I’m aware they play in a large city, but the value was really driven by winning).  And while LA is a large market, it’s also a transplant city.  There are a ton of non-Dodger fans here unlike say, St Louis or another large-enough-for-a-team cit...",:Message: | Discussion,self.mlb,MLB

You have a guy on first and third with one out.  They literally can’t risk making the throw to second.  Any actual throw where they try to get the runner then guy at third scores (even with it being Guerrero Jr.).

Only chance would be one of those cut off throws where short stop cuts it off but the Guerrero Jr. just doesn’t go home.

Roberts said Yamamoto is off the boards but basically everybody else is available. For the Jays, Schneider didn't explicitly say so, but I am assuming Gausman is not available.

Glasnow would have gotten the ball tonight had he not pitched last night.

I'm sure Ohtani will be more than a one-inning guy, but how long? One turn through the rotation or what? With the starting pitcher/DH rule, of course, it's safe to remove him at any point. Is Glasnow No. 2 up after him?

And the pen? Did Sasaki have (MLB) rookie nerves last night? If so, how does that play tonight?

Scherzer of course has lots of experience, skill and grit, but how much does he actually have in his tank?
